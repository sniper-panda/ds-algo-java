### Recursion - Not as simple as the Age-Old explanation of 'A method which calls itself'

âœ¨ The crux of Recursion is to break the problem down into smaller sub-problems until we get to the smallest problem
whose answer is known to us. I know, a lot of gibberish in one go. Calm down and read till the end.

ðŸ‘€ Try to identify the pattern to break down problems into smaller problems, whether it be String, Array or a number.

âš¡ As soon as we reach the smallest problem whose solution is known to us : Base Case, we can return the final answer which then
builds itself up by providing answers to the smaller problems (Starting from Base Case) which in turn are needed for the bigger sub-problems (Ending at the Problem asked).

ðŸŒ± The questions are so that the topic is eased into, while going through the levels. 

ðŸ’¬ Holler out to me for any suggestions, raise PR's to modify an error (If any)
